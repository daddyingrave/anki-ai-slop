Task:
- Generate a comprehensive set of high-quality, ready-to-use Anki cards directly from the article.
- Ensure each card is self-contained and includes just enough context to stand alone.
- Prefer atomic prompts; avoid overlapping or duplicate questions.
- If a simple ASCII sketch clarifies a complex idea, include it.
- Silently derive a coverage checklist from the article (major sections, key concepts, and any code blocks). Ensure at least one high-value card per checklist item. Do not output the checklist.
- Absolutely do not use backticks or Markdown; if minimal code is needed, use <code>inline</code> or <pre><code>block</code></pre> and MathJax \( \)/\[ \] only.
- Do not include questions related to code listings
