Unified rules for translating vocabulary words (apply to BOTH translation and review steps)

Output requirements:
- Produce translations that are accurate, context-appropriate, and educationally valuable
- Every translation must be self-contained and useful for language learning
- Lemmas must be correct base forms of words (check for spaCy errors)

Translation quality rules:
- Accuracy: Translations must reflect the actual meaning in context
- Consistency: Related words should use consistent terminology
- Brevity: Keep translations concise (1-3 words typically)
- Natural language: Use natural, idiomatic expressions in target languages
- Educational value: Prioritize commonly used translations over rare ones

Context translation specific rules:
- Word translations must match the specific meaning in the sentence
- Sentence translations must be natural and fluent
- Include the full Russian sentence translation with the FIRST word only
- Set russian_sentence to null for all subsequent words
- Phrasal verbs must be translated as a unit (mark is_phrasal_verb=true)
- Function words that don't translate directly should have linguistic explanations

General translation specific rules:
- Focus on the most common, general meanings (not context-specific)
- Provide up to 2 most frequent translations per language
- Translations should work across multiple contexts
- Proper nouns should return empty lists
- Each language's translations are independent

Lemma verification rules:
- Check that lemmas are correct base forms (infinitive for verbs, singular for nouns, etc.)
- Common spaCy errors to watch for:
  - Incorrectly lemmatized phrasal verbs (e.g., "look up" â†’ "look" instead of "look up")
  - Past participles not reduced to infinitive
  - Plural nouns not reduced to singular
  - Gerunds (-ing forms) that should be infinitives
- If a lemma is incorrect, correct it in the output

Translation verification checklist:
- Russian translations use appropriate grammatical forms
- Spanish translations match in number/gender where applicable
- No English words in translation fields
- No placeholder text like "...", "TBD", etc.
- Translations are appropriate for the part of speech
- No duplicate translations in the same language list
