Unified rules for translating vocabulary words (apply to BOTH translation and review steps)

Output requirements:
- Produce translations that are accurate, context-appropriate, and educationally valuable
- Every translation must be self-contained and useful for language learning
- Lemmas must be correct base forms of words (check for spaCy errors)

Translation quality rules:
- Accuracy: Translations must reflect the actual meaning in context
- Consistency: Related words should use consistent terminology
- Brevity: Keep translations concise (1-3 words typically)
- Natural language: Use natural, idiomatic expressions in target languages
- Educational value: Prioritize commonly used translations over rare ones

Context translation specific rules:
- **CRITICAL**: Word translations MUST be the exact word/form extracted from the sentence translation
- Process workflow:
  1. First, ensure the sentence translation is correct and natural
  2. Then, extract each word from the corrected sentence translation
  3. If you fix the sentence, update word translations to match the new sentence
  4. If you fix a word translation, ensure it matches what's in the sentence
- After translating the sentence, locate each word in the translated sentence
- Use the EXACT grammatical form that appears in the translated sentence
- For compound phrases, use the exact phrase as it appears
- DO NOT create separate translations - extract from the sentence
- Sentence translations must be natural and fluent
- Set russian_sentence to null for all subsequent words
- Phrasal verbs must be translated as a unit (mark is_phrasal_verb=true)
- But every word from phrasal verb also should be translated separately
- Function words that don't translate directly should have linguistic explanations

Example of correct word extraction:
- English: "he turned his head"
- Russian sentence: "он отвернул голову"
- Word to translate: "turn" (as "turned")
- Correct russian_word_translation: "отвернул" (exact form from sentence)
- Incorrect: "повернул" (different word, not in sentence)

Another example:
- English: "for you"
- Russian sentence: "за тобой"
- Word to translate: "you"
- Correct russian_word_translation: "тобой" (exact form from sentence)
- Incorrect: "тебя" (different case, not matching sentence)

General translation specific rules:
- Focus on the most common, general meanings (not context-specific)
- Provide up to 2 most frequent translations per language
- Translations should work across multiple contexts
- Proper nouns should return empty lists
- Each language's translations are independent

Lemma verification rules:
- Check that lemmas are correct base forms (infinitive for verbs, singular for nouns, etc.)
- Common spaCy errors to watch for:
  - Past participles not reduced to infinitive
  - Plural nouns not reduced to singular
  - Gerunds (-ing forms) that should be infinitives
- If a lemma is incorrect, correct it in the output

Translation verification checklist:
- Russian translations use appropriate grammatical forms
- Spanish translations match in number/gender where applicable
- No English words in translation fields
- No placeholder text like "...", "TBD", etc.
- Translations are appropriate for the part of speech
- No duplicate translations in the same language list
