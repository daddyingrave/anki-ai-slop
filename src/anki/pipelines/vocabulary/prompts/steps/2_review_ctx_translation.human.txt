Words to translate:

Current translations (JSON):
{translations_json}

Task:
- Review and fix the translations to ensure accuracy, naturalness, and consistency
- Verify lemmas are correct base forms (fix any spaCy lemmatization errors)
- **Bidirectional consistency check**:
  1. First, check if the sentence translation is correct and natural
  2. If sentence needs fixing, fix it AND update all word translations to match the new sentence
  3. If word translation is wrong but sentence is correct, update the word to match the sentence
  4. ALWAYS maintain: russian_word_translation MUST be extracted from russian_sentence
- **CRITICAL**: Each russian_word_translation is the EXACT form extracted from russian_sentence
  - Word translations MUST match the exact form in the sentence
  - If you change the sentence, you MUST update the words
  - If you change a word, ensure the sentence contains that exact form
- Fix any grammatical errors or unnatural phrasing
- Verify translations are appropriate for each word's part of speech
- Ensure phrasal verbs are correctly identified and translated as units

Examples of bidirectional fixes:
- If sentence "он повернул голову" should be "он отвернул голову", update "turn" word to "отвернул"
- If word "тебя" doesn't match sentence "за тобой", change word to "тобой"
