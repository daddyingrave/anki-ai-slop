Task:
- Review and fix the deck to maximize clarity, correctness, and self-containment.
- Remove/merge duplicates and near-duplicates; keep the clearest version.
- Ensure strict adherence to the unified rules.
- Cross-check coverage against the article’s major sections. If gaps exist (e.g., missing pitfalls, complexities), add or revise cards to close them.
- Ensure claims match the source’s conventions (do not “correct” the source to standard definitions unless the source itself says so).
- Eliminate any backticks or Markdown remnants; convert inline code to <code>…</code> and fenced code to <pre><code>…</code></pre>. Use MathJax \( \)/\[ \] only for math.
- Eliminate any questions related to code listings
